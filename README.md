# 📊 Dynamic Data Table

A responsive and interactive data table built with **[your chosen framework: React/Vanilla JS/etc.]** that displays user records with features like sorting, searching, filtering, pagination, row actions, row selection, and export options.  

This project was built **without using any prebuilt DataTable plugins** — all logic is implemented manually.
